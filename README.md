# Wordle
The popular Wordle game in Swift (Appkit/Cocoa)

Wordlists come from mysterious sources.  The set of possible answers is smaller (2300) than the set of possible guesses.
Targeted to macOS 14.0.  Acts much like the NY Times one, although with enhanced cell acrobatics. 

It doesn't keep records or analyze the quality of your responses as the NYT one does.
